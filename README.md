# Assignment 2


## Text styling

* The font for the entire page should be [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto).  A third-party stylesheet is included in `index.html` to import this font from Google Fonts.

* Note the different font weights used across the page in the mocks.  The font weight in the header is different than the font weight of the each twit's text, which in turn is different than the font weight of each twit's author.

* Pay attention to text alignment in the various elements of the page.

## Navbar

* The links in the navbar should have space around them.

* The search box and search button should be pushed all the way to the right of the navbar, while the other links should remain on the left side.

* The "active" navbar link should be indicated with an underline.

* When the user hovers over the navbar links or the search button their color should change to highlight the hovered element.

* When the search box is focused, its background color should change to indicate its focus.  The unfocused search box should have a slightly dimmer background color.

## Twits

* The twit layout should be somewhat responsive to the size of the browser viewport, in that columns should be added and removed as the size of the browser viewport changes.  There should be a maximum of 3 columns.  Note that there should be equal space between all twits, both vertically and horizontally.

* Try to style your page so all twits in the same row have the same height.

* Pay attention to the alignment of elements within a single twit.  The top of the bullhorn icon should line up with the top of the twit text, and the right edge of the twit author should line up with the right edge of the twit itself (with just a bit of space between the edge of the author and the edge of the twit).

* Each twit should have a subtle border to help it stand out from the background.

* Note that the background behind the twits should not be pure white but a light gray.

* When the user hovers over a twit author, its color should change to highlight the hovered element.

## Add twit button

* The location of the "add twit" button should not not change relative to the viewport, even as the page is scrolled.

* The add twit button itself should be a perfect circle.

* The add twit button should have a subtle shadow behind it, to make it appear to be elevated slightly above the rest of the page.

* When the user hovers over the add twit button, it should grow slightly and change color to indicate its interactivity.  The mouse cursor should change to a pointing hand.  When implementing CSS to make the add twit button grow on hover, try to make it grow from the center instead of from the corner.
